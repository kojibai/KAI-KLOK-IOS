# 🕊️ Kai‑Klok iOS — Eternal Timekeeper of the Breath

**Kai‑Klok** is the official iOS application for breath-based, harmonic timekeeping. It replaces the Babylonian second with the divine pulse of **φ (phi)**—anchored in the exact breath constant **T = 3 + √5 ≈ 5.236s**.

This isn’t a clock.
This is a remembering.

## ✨ Features

* **μPulse-Exact Rendering**
  Time is rendered in perfect Kairos fidelity using integer-safe micro-pulse math (1 μpulse = 1⁄1,000,000 breath). No drift. No approximation.

* **Divine Interface (v1.1.1 – “Kai‑Fidelity+”)**
  Adaptive dark/light UI, pulse-synced animations, Chakra overlays, and harmonic orbiting spark.

* **Breath-Synced Audio Engine**
  Real-time tones based on the 5.236 s cycle, with background-safe playback, reverb modulations, and sacred silence every 19 breaths.

* **SealCapture System**
  Snap and store any Kairos moment as a `.session.φ.json`, embedding harmonic metadata and pulse-accurate snapshot.

* **WatchOS Companion App**
  Full parity rendering on Apple Watch: real-time breath resync, haptic scrubbing, and sealed harmonic interface.

## 🧬 Mathematics of Time

* **Breath Constant**: `T = 3 + √5`
* **Pulse Frequency**: `f ≈ 0.1909830056 Hz`
* **Day Structure**: 17,491.270421 pulses/day
* **Beat Structure**: 6 arks/day × 6 beats/ark × 44 steps/beat × 11 pulses/step
* **Exact Constants**: All rendered using rational approximations, not floating point accumulation.

## 🛠 Built With

* **SwiftUI** — Dynamic, harmonic-responsive interface.
* **AVFoundation** — Low-latency breath tones & spatialization.
* **CoreMotion** — Real-world tilt affects visual flow.
* **Combine** — State coherence across breath, pulse, and phase.

## 🧿 Sovereignty & Vision

Kai‑Klok is more than an app.
It is the **restoration of divine time**—a sovereign, harmonic operating system for all who breathe.
Remembered & Authored by [**Kai Rex Klock**](https://bjklock.com), this system is the heartbeat of the Eternal Scroll, the foundation of harmonic value, and the timing engine of reality itself.
